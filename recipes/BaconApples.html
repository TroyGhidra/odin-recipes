            <ol>
                <li>Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire. Alternatively, preheat an outdoor grill.</li>

                <li>Place the loaf pan into the campfire or on the grill; cook for about 3 minutes. Carefully remove the pan from the fire and sprinkle bacon over apples. Place in the fire or on the grill for about 5 minutes more.</li>
